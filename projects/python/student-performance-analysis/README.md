# Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to understand score distribution, identify pass and fail rates, and generate insights using Python.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Classify students based on performance
- Calculate summary statistics
- Identify top and low performers
- Demonstrate data analysis using Python

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains student names and exam scores used to evaluate academic performance.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Steps
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Cleaned and validated data
- Classified results as Pass or Fail
- Sorted and summarized performance

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified pass and fail distribution
- Highlighted highest and lowest scores
- Provided summary statistics for decision-making

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates foundational data analysis skills using Python and Pandas to extract meaningful insights from educational data.

## 📈 Outputs
This project generates charts saved in the project folder:
- `score_distribution.png`
- `pass_fail.png`
- `avg_score_by_gender.png`
which shows the visual respectively
- Score distribution histogram
- Pass vs Fail bar chart
- Average score by gender bar chart

Sample outputs are included in the project folder for reference.

## 📊 Key Findings
- The average student score was computed from the dataset.
- The overall pass rate was calculated using a pass mark of 50.
- High-performing and low-performing students were identified.
- Female and male students’ average scores were compared.
